play-partials
=============



A library used to retrieve HTML partials to use when composing HTML Play frontend applications.

In supports caching the partials.

## Adding to your service

Include the following dependency in your SBT build

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("hmrc", "releases")

libraryDependencies += "uk.gov.hmrc" %% "play-partials" % "x.x.x"
```

## The `HtmlPartial` type

Use this type to read an HTTP response containing a partial, and safely 
handle the possible outcomes:

* For success (2xx) status codes, an `HtmlPartial.Success`
is returned, which contains the HTML body and optionally a hint on the title that
should be used on the page.
* For non-success (400 -> 599) status codes, an `HtmlPartial.Failure` is returned
* A handler is also supplied which translates connection-related exceptions into an
`HtmlPartial.Failure`

#### Examples

```scala
import HtmlPartial._

object Connector {
	def somePartial(): Future[HtmlPartial] = 
	  http.GET[HtmlPartial](url("/some/url")) recover connectionExceptionsAsHtmlPartialFailure
}

// Elsewhere in your service:
Connector.partial.map(p =>
  Ok(views.html.my_view(partial = p successfulContentOrElse Html("Sorry, there's been a problem retrieving ...")))
)

// or, if you just want to blank out a missing partial:
Connector.partial.map(p =>
  Ok(views.html.my_view(partial = p successfulContentOrEmpty))
)

// or, if you want to have finer-grained control:
Connector.partial.map {
  case HtmlPartial.Success(Some(title), content) => 
    Ok(views.html.my_view(message = content, title = title))
  case HtmlPartial.Success(None, content)        => 
    Ok(views.html.my_view(message = content, title = "A fallback title"))
  case HtmlPartial.Failure                       => 
    Ok(views.html.my_view(message = Html("Sorry, there's been a technical problem retrieving your info"), title = "A fallback title"))
}
```

## Using cached static partials

If you need to use a static cached partial, use the `CachedStaticHtmlPartialRetriever` trait. It will retrieve the partial from the given URL and cache it (the cache key is the partial URL) for the defined period of time. You can also pass through a map of parameters used to replace placeholders in the retrieved partial. Placeholders have the form of `{{parameterKey}}`.

You can manage the cache parameters by overriding `refreshAfter`, `expireAfter` and `maximumEntries` attributes.

### A simple example of using the partials provider

```scala
object CachedStaticHtmlPartialProvider extends CachedStaticHtmlPartial {
  override val httpGet = ???
}

val partial = CachedStaticHtmlPartialProvider.get("http://my.partial")
```

###Â Using HTML Form partials

A special case of the static partials are HTML forms. By using `FormPartialRetriever` a `{{csrfToken}}` placeholder will be replaced with the Play CSRF token value.
